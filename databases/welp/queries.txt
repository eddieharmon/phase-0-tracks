3)There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT businesses.name,reviews.stars,users.first_name,reviews.comment FROM reviews INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id INNER JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id;
Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|Bradford|Great food!
Amir's Towing|3|Angela|Terrible customer service!
The Beagle Nightclub|4|Steven|Good people, bad location.
Lotus Yoga|1|Mandy|I would give 0 stars if I could.

(or, done in the same order as stated in question 3...)

SELECT users.first_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id INNER JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id;
Bradford|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|Great food!
Angela|Amir's Towing|3|Terrible customer service!
Steven|The Beagle Nightclub|4|Good people, bad location.
Mandy|Lotus Yoga|1|I would give 0 stars if I could.


4)How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?
SELECT * FROM reviews INNER JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id INNER JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id WHERE businesses.name = "The Beagle Nightclub";
